1. How do we allow for sensors with richer representations?
2. How do we allow for actuators that require complex instruction?
3. Our current GA code assumes that all transformation functions of interest affect a single variable at a time. This is not sufficient. We need to be able to consider transformations of the vector of variable values.


Things to change:
_ collapse pure functions of paramters into a single (unique) parameter
_ only accept choices of constant that move the state more than x% of the dynamic range
_ do not allow pure functions of paramters as candidate symmetries
_ need to be able to remove components when mutating
